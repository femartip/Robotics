## KM&EKF - Kalman Filter & Extended Kalman Filter
  - This folder contians variuous implementations for a Turtlebot. This was simulated using the ROS environment. To try the programms, the "kalman_simulation" is needed, and should be placed as a ROS package. 
  
  -> KFBasicMotion.py; This program uses the kalman filter for a basic turtlebot, where the motion is based on a relative position between the beacon and the robot frame. The robot uses spherical wheels and only moves in a straight line.

  To try this, launch in ros exercise_1_spherical_wheels.launch
